quote: During more than ten years of working, I became part of various teams with people with bad attitudes, irresponsible, and uncommitted; I also had the pleasure of collaborating with unique people like Misael Taveras. I can say that Misael is dedicated to constantly improving and working as a team. He is always clear about his responsibilities.
