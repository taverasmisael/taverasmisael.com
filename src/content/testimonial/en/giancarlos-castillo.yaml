quote: Without a doubt, Misael is synonymous with good work. Much of my personal/professional growth has been thanks to Misael. My way of seeing, thinking, and analyzing each line of code and my enormous passion for Software Engineering is the reflection of someone who has been my mentor without realizing it.
