## Who am I?

<span class="text-xl">I was born in 1996, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</span>

I started learning how to code when I was 14 years old, with a not-so-legal copy of Visual Studio 2008. I was hooked since then.
Somehow my dad got a PDF of a book about Macromedia Dreamweaver, that even though it was outdated, it was enough to get me started.

Since that, I've been learning on my own grabing every opportunity I could to learn more about programming. By the time **I graduated in Computer Science in 2018**, I already had years of experience working as a developer on-site and as a freelancer.
But I didn't stop there, I'm always learning new things, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

## What I do?

The term FrontEnd Engineer can mean a lot of things, but for me, it means that I'm a developer that is focused on the user experience, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it.

For **the user** it means that the software will be fast, responsive, intuitive, and easy to use.

For **the company**, it means that the software will be delivered on time, easy to maintain, and extend.

For **me**, it means that I will be able to work on a project that I can be proud of, and that I will be able to learn new things.

### User experience
  
  > Start with the user in mind, and everything else will follow.
  
  A website, or an app usually is the point of contact between the user and the company. Web performance, accessibility, and usability are key to provide a good user experience.
  
  **Web performance** I know how frustrating it can be to use a slow and unresponsive website. So I always aproach every situation with a progressive enhancement mindset.

  **Accessibility** In contrast with other platforms, the web can be accessed from almost any device. With screens of all sizes, color ranges, and input methods; so thinking about accesibility is a topic that should be always on the table.

### Developer experience
  
  > Developers spend more time reading code than writing it.
  
  Having a good developer experience is key to have a good developer productivity. And good developer productivity means more value to our users.
  
  **Code quality** I always try to write code that is easy to read, and easy to understand avoiding unnecessary complexity and [hasty abstractions](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming?utm_source=taverasmisael).

  **Testing & Documentation** Part of being productive is not wasting time figuring out how things work. Havig the confidence that your changes won't break something else sometimes is underated. Writting good docs and tests has saved *future Misael* a handful of times.

### Helping others

> The end of all knowledge should be service to others.

Althought I enjoy coding, I recently discovered that I find more joy helping others to improve their skills. I'm always looking for ways to help others to improve their skills.

**Teamwork** The best high quality software is built by teams, not by individuals. Relaying on others and helping others is key to build great software.

**Mentoring** Sometimes having a one-on-one conversation with someone can be more valuable than reading a book, or watching a video. That's why I try to be [available](/en/contact) for questions and help as much as possible.

I try to write about the things that I wish I knew when I started learning about them.
