Hello

## Environment

- Node.js 19+
- PNPM 8+

### Environment variables

Most of these are standard, but some are specific to this project.

- `LOCAL_BUILD`: Set to `true` to enable local build mode. This will disable Analytics, Algolia, and will use `@astrojs/node` adapter instead of `@astrojs/netlify`. This is useful for testing and debugging.
